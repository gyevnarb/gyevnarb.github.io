My research is about the <i>metascience of artificial intelligence</i>.
I am interested in computational (e.g. algorithms) and empirical methods (e.g. cognitive experiments) of understanding how AI is being researched and how AI affects researchers.
My work is in collaboration with [Atoosa Kasirzadeh](https://kasirzadeh.org/) and [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/) at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive science, and the philosophy of science.
During my PhD, I worked on explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning under the supervision of [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents-lab.org/stefano-albrecht/), [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/), and [Chris Lucas](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clucas2/).

I am currently most curious about three questions:
- <b>How do human and AI-written research differ?</b> How do we compare both the high-level conceptual and low-level methodological patterns of human and AI-assisted research, and can we predict based on the differences and similarities to where our research will steer?
- <b>How do we protect scientific integrity in the age of scientist AIs?</b> What are the methodological pitfalls of end-to-end automated scientist AIs, and how do we create controlled computational tools with statistical guarantees to prevent those pitfalls?
- <b>How do we bridge the research problems of disparate fields of AI?</b> What are the shared and distinct research problems addressed in disparate fields of AI, especially AI safety and ethics, and can we bridge differences to avoid wasting our time?
