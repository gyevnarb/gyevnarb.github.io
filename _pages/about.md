I am interested in building trustworthy <em>explainable</em> autonomous agents especially for multi-agent systems, with applications to autonomous vehicles, and an additional focus on AI safety and trust.

My supervisors are:
- [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/)
- [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/)
- [Chris Lucas](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clucas2/).

<hr />

I began researching how we might make better explanations for autonomous vehicles.
I quickly realised along the way that the current state of explainable AI (XAI) is broken.
Existing methods only work for some models with particular asumptions, they ignore OOD data, always assume that the AI model is correct, and so on...

Worst of all, most of XAI is unapproachable to most users who have no expertise with AI systems.
This inspired me to look into exploring better ways to create **intelligible explanations that calibrate trust** according to the abilities of the autonomous system.

I am interested in creating more trustworthy autonomous systems that are based on intelligible causal explanations and provide recourse through a conversational process. Recently, I have also become interested in applying these methods to agentic systems and its implications on AI safety and AI ethics.


## Tidbits about me

I often spend my free time learning languages. Currently, I speak four: Hungarian, English, German, and Japanese. I am also actively learning Chinese.

I like playing volleyball and I was the the treasurer (2022-23) and vice president (2023-24) of the Edinburgh University Volleyball Club. I play setter. I also enjoy walking with people among the stark landscapes of the Scottish Highlands and taking some breathtaking [photos](https://www.instagram.com/balinthy/) while enduring harsh wet weather.

Occasionally, I sit down to practise the piano. At the moment, I am working through the second movement of Schubert's piano sonata in B-flat major ([D 960](https://youtu.be/MAZ8PA5_gVA)). Currently, I am reading "Boldog ​boldogtalan" by Háy János. A list of books I have read since I began keeping records is [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62432429?sort=date_read).
