<p style="margin-top: -1em;"><em>(My name is pronounced as BAH-lint [baːlint ɟɛvnaːɾ])</em></p>

I research trustworthy _explainable autonomous agency_ in multi-agent systems for AI safety, with applications to autonomous vehicles.
I like to explain this as _giving AI agents the ability to explain themselves._

I am lucky to be supervised by three amazing scientists: [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/), [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/), [Chris Lucas](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clucas2/).



<br />

I began my research by looking at how we can make better explanations for autonomous vehicles.
I realised quickly that the current state of _explainable AI (XAI) is broken._
Existing methods only work for some models with particular asumptions, they ignore OOD data, always assume that the AI agent is correct, and so on...

The biggest issue however is that _explanations are simply not made to help users_ who interact with AI agents.
They are usually there to help the developers only.

So now I am interested in exploring better ways to create intelligible explanations to _calibrate trust according to the abilities of the AI agents_.
I also research the epistemic backgrounds of AI ethics and AI safety to understand how explanations can help create more transparent systems considering both the short- and long-term risks of AI.

### about me

I often spend my free time learning languages. Currently, I speak four: Hungarian, English, German, and Japanese. I am also actively learning Chinese.

I like playing volleyball and I was the the treasurer (2022-23) and vice president (2023-24) of the Edinburgh University Volleyball Club. I play setter. I also enjoy walking with people among the stark landscapes of the Scottish Highlands and taking some breathtaking [photos](https://www.instagram.com/balinthy/) while enduring harsh wet weather.

Occasionally, I sit down to practise the piano. At the moment, I am working through the second movement of Schubert's piano sonata in B-flat major ([D 960](https://youtu.be/MAZ8PA5_gVA)). Currently, I am reading "Boldog ​boldogtalan" by Háy János. A list of books I have read since I began keeping records is [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62432429?sort=date_read).
