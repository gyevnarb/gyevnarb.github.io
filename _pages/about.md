My research is concerned with <b>artificial intelligence (AI) in science and the science in AI.</b>
I am interested in computational (e.g. algorithms) and empirical methods (e.g. cognitive experiments) of understanding how AI can be used to safely and sustainably enhance human scientific discovery.
I am working with [Atoosa Kasirzadeh](https://kasirzadeh.org/) and [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/) at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive science, and the philosophy of science.
During my PhD, I worked on explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning under the supervision of [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents-lab.org/stefano-albrecht/), [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/), and [Chris Lucas](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clucas2/) at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

I am currently most curious about three questions:
- <b>How do we protect scientific integrity in the age of agentic AI scientists? </b> What are the methodological pitfalls of scientific AI systems, and how do we create controlled computational tools with statistical guarantees to prevent them?
- <b>How does the use of AI in science affect the way scientists think and act?</b> What are the epistemological dangers of delegating scientific thinking to AI systems, and how does AI change the high-level conceptual and low-level methodological steps of science?
- <b>How do scientific communities change as a result of scientific AI deployment?</b> What are the effects of AI-accelerated scientific discovery on research communities' interests, and what are scientists' beliefs and desires for AI in science?
