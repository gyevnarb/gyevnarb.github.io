Hi, I am Bálint. Thanks for checking on my home page! <br/>
_(My name is pronounced BAH-lint [baːlint])_

I research trustworthy _explainable autonomous agency_ in multi-agent systems for AI safety, with applications to autonomous vehicles.
I like to describe this as _giving AI agents the ability to explain themselves._

I am primarly interested in exploring better ways to create intelligible explanations to _calibrate trust_ in and _understand the reasoning_ of AI agents.

I also work on briding the epistemic foundations and resesarch problems of AI ethics and safety to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration.

I am a member of the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents-lab.org/), supervised by [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/) and [Chris Lucas](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clucas2/). I was previously supervised by [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents-lab.org/stefano-albrecht/).
